Perfect! I've successfully implemented the mode system. Here's a summary of what was created:

  Mode System Implementation

  1. ModeManager.cs - Core mode system

  - GameMode enum: Explore, Placement, Battle
  - P key toggle: Switches between Explore and Placement modes
  - Battle condition: Automatically switches to Battle mode when inBattle = true
  - Mode transitions: Handles entering/exiting each mode properly

  2. Updated PlacementUIController.cs

  - Mode display: Shows current mode in the mode label
  - Conditional UI: Unit count and selected unit labels only visible in Placement mode
  - Real-time updates: UI updates when mode changes

  3. Updated UnitPlacementManager.cs

  - Integration: Now works with ModeManager instead of managing its own placement state
  - Placement logic: Only active during Placement mode
  - Mode callbacks: OnEnterPlacementMode() and OnExitPlacementMode() methods

  Key Features:

  - Explore Mode: Default state for moving around the map and clicking enemies
  - Placement Mode: Press P to enter, allows unit placement with visual feedback
  - Battle Mode: Automatically activated when inBattle = true, blocks placement mode
  - UI Integration: Shows mode name and conditionally displays placement-specific UI elements
  - Input Handling: P key toggles between Explore and Placement (disabled during battle)

  The system is now ready for use. You'll need to add the ModeManager component to a GameObject in your     
   scene to activate the system.
