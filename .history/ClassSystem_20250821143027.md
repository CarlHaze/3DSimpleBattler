ean but expandable foundation for a class + stat system in a tactics-style Unity 6 game. I'll keep it simple and modular so you can add complexity later without rewriting everything.

1. Core Stat System
Make a base CharacterStats class to hold common attributes (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.).

using UnityEngine;

[System.Serializable]
public class CharacterStats
{
    public int Level = 1;
    public int MaxHP = 100;
    public int CurrentHP;
    public int Attack = 10;
    public int Defense = 5;
    public int Speed = 5;
    public int Magic = 0;

    public CharacterStats()
    {
        CurrentHP = MaxHP;
    }

    public void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        int damage = Mathf.Max(amount - Defense, 1);
        CurrentHP = Mathf.Clamp(CurrentHP - damage, 0, MaxHP);
    }

    public void Heal(int amount)
    {
        CurrentHP = Mathf.Clamp(CurrentHP + amount, 0, MaxHP);
    }
}


2. Base Character Class

Tie stats + job/class info together.

public class Character : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string CharacterName;
    public CharacterStats Stats;
    public CharacterClass CharacterClass;

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Stats == null)
            Stats = new CharacterStats();

        if (CharacterClass != null)
            CharacterClass.ApplyClassStats(Stats);
    }
}


3. Job / Class System

Each job can define stat modifiers and abilities.

[CreateAssetMenu(menuName = "TacticsGame/CharacterClass")]
public class CharacterClass : ScriptableObject
{
    public string ClassName;
    public int BonusHP;
    public int BonusAttack;
    public int BonusDefense;
    public int BonusSpeed;
    public int BonusMagic;

    public void ApplyClassStats(CharacterStats stats)
    {
        stats.MaxHP += BonusHP;
        stats.Attack += BonusAttack;
        stats.Defense += BonusDefense;
        stats.Speed += BonusSpeed;
        stats.Magic += BonusMagic;

        stats.CurrentHP = stats.MaxHP;
    }
}
This way you can create classes like Knight, Mage, etc. directly in the Unity inspector as ScriptableObjects.

4. Example Usage

Make a Character prefab with the Character component.

Assign a CharacterClass (e.g., "Knight").

When game starts, stats get modified by the class.

5. Next Steps to Build On

Add abilities to CharacterClass (list of ScriptableObjects).

Add equipment modifiers that further adjust stats.

Add experience + leveling system that boosts base stats.

This gives you:
✅ Flexible CharacterStats base.
✅ Classes as ScriptableObjects for easy tweaking.
✅ Expandable without rewriting core logic.
